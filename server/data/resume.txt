 Backdoor Attacks Detection Using Neural Networks | Python, TensorFlow
 August,2023- October,2023
 • Identified and analyzed common techniques used by attackers to implant backdoors in machine-learning
 models
 • Augumented a dataset with over 42000 images classified in 9 different categories of backdoor attacks
 • Developed highly accurate Deep Learning model that can detect various types of Backdoor Attacks on Machine
 Learning models with a high degree of Precision and Recall
 • Obtained a max Precision of 98.06 Percent by using Transfer Learning technique on VGG-16 model
 Medical AI Chatbot | Python, Langchain
 February, 2024- April,2024
 • Built a chatbot using LangChain, FAISS, and LLama-2 to answer medical queries with accuracy.
 • Embedded medical PDFs using HuggingFace models and stored them in a FAISS vector database for efficient
 search.
 • Integrated Chainlit to create a user-friendly chatbot experience with real-time query handling and source tracking.
 Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dashboard | Python, Selenium, HuggingFace
 October, 2024
 • Developed a real-time Twitter analysis platform that scrapes tweets using Selenium and provides actionable
 insights on user-selected topics.
 • Integrated HuggingFace Transformers to gauge user sentiment, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
 for summarizing large sets of tweets effectively, and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) for advance topic
 modeling, categorizing tweets into themes.
 • Built an interactive dashboard to visualize user engagement metrics, trending topics, sentiment analysis, and
 topic-specific summaries.
 • Demonstrated use cases such as brand monitoring, competitor analysis, and issue categorization with data-driven
 visualizations.
